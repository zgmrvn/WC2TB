# What it is
WC2TB is a small program that let you convert objects data from a World Creator project into Arma's Terrain Builder format. It is very usefull for mass object placement, especially for trees.

# How it works
Simply drag and drop your `SyncTool.xml` file on `WC2TB.exe`, the program will proceed and create as much files as layers your project has.
